    "While the overall air quality is good, the elevated levels of CO and O3 could pose health risks, especially for sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions. It is advisable to stay indoors during peak traffic hours to avoid exposure to CO, and to limit outdoor activities during high O3 periods, typically in the afternoon and early evening.",
  insights: [
    "The CO levels are relatively high, which could indicate significant vehicular traffic or industrial activity in the area.",
    "Ozone levels are within a range that could cause respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals.",
    "Particulate matter levels are low, suggesting that there are no significant sources of dust or particulate emissions in the immediate area.",
  ],
  possible_causes:
    "The data shows a relatively low AQI of 2, indicating good air quality. However, the presence of CO (carbon monoxide) at 260.35 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 and O3 (ozone) at 75.82 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 suggests that there may be some industrial or vehicular emissions contributing to the air quality. The low levels of PM2.5 and PM10 indicate that particulate matter is not a significant issue at this time.",
